wintermelon
======

This is a Firefox extension. Open wintermelon.xpi in order to install the addon.  This addon is compiled with [JetPack](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/index.html#getting-started "JetPack Tutorial").

You can read about what this addon does on my [blog](http://usamo.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/email-jetpack-and-wintermelon/).  It is basically an implementation of XKCD #862, which places a time delay whenever I try to access Facebook, Gmail, Art of Problem Solving, etc.

One can adjust the websites and timeouts by modifying the preferences from the Add-Ons menu.  The options should be fairly self-explanatory :)
